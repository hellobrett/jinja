# Extraction Templater

## Introduction

TODO: Add description of project

## TODO
* What about making this a package for `pip install templater` !!!????
* Config should be a YML file, not hard-coded JSON
* Look at some of the more difficult variables 
  * How to structure files to be more consistent
  * Concern: need to address template structure before building the tool
  * Templater must recognize different variable types, e.g., range values
